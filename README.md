# Notch

Double-tap the right Option key. AI appears. Ask anything. That's it.

## Install

```bash
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/Notch /Applications/
```

First launch: grant Accessibility permission. Click menu bar icon to set your Anthropic API key.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Right Option` ×2 | Open / close |
| `Enter` | Send |
| `Escape` | Close |
| `Tab` | Commands (clear chat, etc.) |

## What it can do

- **Answer questions** — Claude Haiku, fast and direct
- **Search the web** — finds current info when needed
- **See your screen** — takes a screenshot when context helps
- **Remember things** — persistent memory across sessions

Conversations persist between launches. Your history stays until you clear it.

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- Anthropic API key
- Accessibility permission (for the keyboard shortcut)

## Why

Spotlight can't think. ChatGPT breaks flow. Sometimes you need a quick answer without leaving what you're doing.

The best interface disappears.
